Spend the most time here.\n\n**⚠️ The #1 reason dashboards look like \"AI slop\" is a boring, symmetrical grid layout.** Real designers create visual tension and flow. Your layout must feel hand-crafted by a senior product designer for THIS specific app.\n\n### Think Like a Product Designer\n\nBefore drawing anything, answer:\n\n1. **What is the ONE thing users must see first?**\n   - This becomes your hero element - the visual anchor\n   - Everything else supports this\n\n2. **What actions do users take most often?**\n   - The #1 action becomes your Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n   - Maximum 1-2 taps/clicks to reach\n   - Position for thumb reach on mobile\n   - This dashboard is interactive, NOT read-only!\n\n3. **What is the user's mental model?**\n   - How do they naturally think about this data?\n   - Your layout should mirror their thinking\n\n4. **What is the user's workflow?**\n   - What sequence of actions do they take?\n   - How can the layout support this flow?\n\n---\n\n### Creating Visual Interest\n\nThe goal is a layout that feels **intentionally designed for THIS app**, not a generic template.\n\n**The core principle:** Every layout needs at least ONE element that creates visual interest - something that breaks the monotony of identical boxes. This could be:\n\n- **Size variation** - One element noticeably larger than others (the hero)\n- **Weight variation** - Mix of bold and subtle elements\n- **Spacing variation** - Tighter grouping within sections, more space between\n- **Format variation** - Mix of cards, inline text, badges (not everything in cards)\n- **Typography variation** - Different sizes that create clear hierarchy\n\n### Symmetric vs Asymmetric Layouts\n\n**Both can work well.** Choose based on what suits the app:\n\n**Symmetric layouts work when:**\n- The app has 2-4 equally important metrics\n- The data is naturally balanced (e.g., income vs expenses)\n- A calm, orderly feel fits the app's purpose\n\n**Asymmetric layouts work when:**\n- There's ONE thing that matters most (clear hero)\n- You want to create visual flow/movement\n- The data has natural hierarchy\n\n**Either way, add visual interest:**\n- If symmetric: vary element sizes, use different treatments for hero\n- If asymmetric: make the hierarchy obvious through sizing\n\n### What Makes a Layout Feel Generic\n\nAvoid these patterns that scream \"AI-generated template\":\n\n- **Everything the same size** - All KPIs identical, all cards identical\n- **No clear hero** - Nothing stands out as most important\n- **Uniform spacing everywhere** - No visual grouping\n- **Only cards** - No inline elements, no variation in container styles\n- **No breathing room** - Elements crammed together without whitespace\n\n### Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\nDesign mobile as a **completely separate experience**, not a squeezed desktop.\n\n**Mobile Principles:**\n- **Vertical flow** - One column, top to bottom\n- **Thumb-friendly** - Important actions in bottom half\n- **Focused** - Show less, but show it well\n- **Progressive** - Reveal details on interaction\n- **Hero stands out** - Make the most important element visually dominant\n\n**Mobile Questions:**\n- What needs to be LARGER for comfortable touch?\n- Where should the primary action live? (Thumb zone)\n- How does the hero stand out from other content?\n- How should content be reorganized to fit the vertical flow?\n\nNote: Only hide elements on mobile if they're truly impossible to use on a phone. Users expect the same functionality on all devices.\n\n**Mobile Layout Ideas:**\n- Hero KPI takes entire top fold, everything else scrolls below\n- Compact horizontal scroll for secondary KPIs\n- Inline summary row (not cards) for quick stats\n- Bottom sheet for additional details\n\n### Desktop Layout\n\nDesign desktop to take full advantage of horizontal space.\n\n**Desktop Principles:**\n- **Use the width** - Multi-column layouts where appropriate\n- **Horizontal density** - Side-by-side information\n- **Hover reveals** - Secondary info on hover\n- **Peripheral vision** - Context without overwhelming\n- **Keyboard awareness** - Power user shortcuts\n\n**Desktop Questions:**\n- How does the extra width add value? (Not just stretching)\n- Which side gets the hero element?\n- What information benefits from side-by-side comparison?\n- What hover states add useful information?\n- Where can you break the grid intentionally?\n\n**Desktop Layout Ideas:**\n- Wide left column (hero + chart) + narrow right column (recent activity)\n- Full-width hero banner, then 3 unequal columns below\n- Sidebar with key stats, main area with detailed views\n- Sticky summary header while scrolling through details\n\n---\n\n## Information Hierarchy\n\nUsers scan, they don't read. Design for scanning.\n\n**Hierarchy Levels:**\n1. **Primary** - ONE thing that matters most (largest, boldest)\n2. **Secondary** - Supporting information (medium)\n3. **Tertiary** - Details, metadata (smallest, muted)\n\n**Hierarchy Tools:**\n- Size (larger = more important)\n- Weight (bolder = more important)\n- Color (accent = important/interactive)\n- Position (top/left = seen first)\n- Space (more whitespace = more important)\n\n---\n\n## Your Output: design_brief.md\n\nWrite a detailed design brief in Markdown.

What proportions?\n- Where does the eye go first, second, third?\n- What creates visual interest in this layout?]\n\n### Section Layout\n[Describe what goes where:\n- Top area: [what content]\n- Main content area: [what content]\n- Supporting areas: [what content]\nInclude proportions if using multi-column layout.]\n\n### What Appears on Hover\n[What extra information is revealed when hovering over elements?]\n\n### Clickable/Interactive Areas (if applicable)\n[If any elements should open detail views when clicked, note them here.\nOnly add where it provides additional useful information.]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Components\n\n### Hero KPI\nThe MOST important metric that users see first.\n\n- **Title:** [Name]\n- **Data source:** [Which app to query]\n- **Calculation:** [How to calculate: sum, count, latest, etc.]\n- **Display:** [How it looks - large number? With icon? Progress ring?]\n- **Context shown:** [What comparison? Goal progress? Trend?]\n- **Why this is the hero:** [Explain why this matters most to users]\n\n### Secondary KPIs\n[For each secondary KPI:]\n\n**[KPI Name]**\n- Source: [App]\n- Calculation: [How]\n- Format: [number/currency/percent]\n- Display: [Card? Inline? Size?]\n\n### Chart (if applicable)\n- **Type:** [line/bar/area - and WHY this type]\n- **Title:** [Chart title]\n- **What question it answers:** [Why does the user need this chart?]\n- **Data source:** [App]\n- **X-axis:** [Field, label]\n- **Y-axis:** [Field, label]\n- **Mobile simplification:** [How is it simplified for small screens?]\n\n### Lists/Tables (if applicable)\n[For each list:]\n\n**[Section Name]**\n- Purpose: [Why users need this]\n- Source: [App]\n- Fields shown: [Which fields]\n- Mobile style: [cards/simple list]\n- Desktop style: [table/cards]\n- Sort: [By what field]\n- Limit: [How many items]\n\n### Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n\n**⚠️ Every dashboard MUST have a primary action.** This is NOT a read-only view!\n\nUsers need to DO things from the dashboard, not just look at data. The most common action should be one tap/click away.\n\nThink about what action users perform most often:\n- Adding a new record (workout, meal, expense, etc.)\n- Logging something (weight, progress, status)\n- Starting a process (timer, session, etc.)\n\n**This section is REQUIRED - do not skip it or write \"None\"!**\n\n- **Label:** [Action-oriented text, e.g. \"Workout starten\", \"Mahlzeit hinzufügen\"]\n- **Action:** [add_record | navigate - specify which]\n- **Target app:** [Which Living Apps app receives the data]\n- **What data:** [What fields will the form contain]\n- **Mobile position:** [bottom_fixed (recommended) | header | fab]\n- **Desktop position:** [header | sidebar | inline]\n- **Why this action:** [Why is this the most important thing users do?]\n\nThe implementation skill knows how to create forms that send data to Living Apps API.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Visual Details\n\n### Border Radius\n[sharp (4px) / rounded (8px) / pill (16px+)]\n\n### Shadows\n[none / subtle / elevated - describe the shadow style]\n\n### Spacing\n[compact / normal / spacious - how much breathing room?]\n\n### Animations\n- **Page load:** [none / fade / stagger]\n- **Hover effects:** [What happens on hover?]\n- **Tap feedback:** [What happens on tap?]\n\n---\n\n## 8. CSS Variables (Copy Exactly!)\n\nThe implementer MUST copy these values exactly into `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --background: hsl(...);\n  --foreground: hsl(...);\n  --card: hsl(...);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --popover: hsl(...);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --primary: hsl(...);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --secondary: hsl(...);\n  --secondary-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --muted: hsl(...);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --accent: hsl(...);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --destructive: hsl(...);\n  --border: hsl(...);\n  --input: hsl(...);\n  --ring: hsl(...);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. Implementation Checklist\n\nThe implementer should verify:\n- [ ] Font loaded from URL above\n- [ ] All CSS variables copied exactly\n- [ ] Mobile layout matches Section 4\n- [ ] Desktop layout matches Section 5\n- [ ] Hero element is prominent as described\n- [ ] Colors create the mood described in Section 2\n```\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ How Colors Are Applied (Critical!)\n\nYour colors are mapped to CSS variables. The implementation agent uses them directly.\n\n**Color Mapping:**\n\n| Your design_brief color | CSS Variable |\n|-------------------------|--------------|\n| `background` | `--background` |\n| `foreground` | `--foreground` |\n| `card` | `--card` |\n| `card_foreground` | `--card-foreground` |\n| `primary` | `--primary` |\n| `primary_foreground` | `--primary-foreground` |\n| `accent` | `--accent` |\n| `muted` | `--muted` |\n| `muted_foreground` | `--muted-foreground` |\n| `border` | `--border` |\n| `negative` | `--destructive` |\n\n**Light Theme Contrast Rules:**\n- `foreground` must be dark (readable on light backgrounds)\n- `card` can be white or slightly off-white\n- `card_foreground` must be dark\n- `primary` needs sufficient contrast for buttons\n\n**All colors MUST be complete hsl() functions:**\n```\n\"background\": \"hsl(40 20% 98%)\"   // ✅ Complete function\n\"background\": \"40 20% 98%\"        // ❌ Will break!\n```\n\n---\n\n## Quality Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing design_brief.md:\n\n### Distinctiveness\n- [ ] Would a designer recognize this as intentionally designed (not default)?\n- [ ] Is there at least ONE memorable visual detail?\n- [ ] Is the font choice appropriate and NOT from forbidden list?\n- [ ] Does the color accent feel considered, not generic?\n\n### Layout & UX (CRITICAL FOR AVOIDING AI SLOP!)\n- [ ] Is there ONE clear hero element that stands out?\n- [ ] Is there visual interest? (size variation, typography hierarchy, spacing variation)\n- [ ] NOT everything the same size - some variation exists\n- [ ] Is mobile designed FOR mobile (not just smaller)?\n- [ ] Does desktop use horizontal space meaningfully?\n- [ ] Would this get featured in the App Store?\n\n### Interactivity\n- [ ] Is the primary action clearly defined?\n- [ ] Are clickable elements marked where drill-down adds value?\n\n### Information\n- [ ] Is the visual hierarchy clear?\n- [ ] Are all relevant KPIs included?\n\n### Clarity\n- [ ] Is every section detailed enough that someone else could implement it?\n- [ ] Are there WHY explanations for major decisions?\n- [ ] Are the CSS variables complete and ready to copy?\n- [ ] Is the Layout Strategy section filled out with specific proportions?\n\n### Technical\n- [ ] Are all colors complete hsl() functions?\n- [ ] Is contrast sufficient for readability?\n- [ ] Are all required colors defined?\n\n---\n\n## Remember\n\n1. **Write for the implementer** - They will follow your words exactly\n2. **Explain WHY** - Context helps them understand intent\n3. **Be specific** - \"Large number\" is vague, \"48px bold\" is specific\n4. **Minimal ≠ Generic** - Minimal can be distinctive\n5. **Layout is everything** - 80% of design time on layout\n6. **Visual interest is required** - Vary sizes, not everything identical\n7. **Mobile ≠ Small Desktop** - Separate experiences\n8. **One memorable detail** - What makes this special?\n9. **App Store quality** - Would Apple feature this?\n","numLines":613,"startLine":1,"totalLines":613}}}

App Analysis\n\n### What This App Does\nThis is an **Order Comparison System (Bestellabgleich-System)** used in B2B procurement workflows. Users upload purchase orders (Bestellungen) and order confirmations (Auftragsbestätigungen), then the system automatically compares them to detect discrepancies in quantities, prices, delivery dates, or item details. This prevents costly errors from mismatched orders going unnoticed until goods arrive.\n\n### Who Uses This\nProcurement specialists, purchasing clerks, and operations managers in mid-sized companies who process multiple supplier orders daily. They need to quickly spot which comparisons failed and what specific differences exist. They're busy, not tech-savvy, and want to see problems at a glance without clicking through multiple screens.\n\n### The ONE Thing Users Care About Most\n**How many comparisons have discrepancies right now?** They want to immediately see if everything is okay (all green) or if there are problems requiring attention (red alerts). The ratio of matched vs. mismatched comparisons is their primary concern.\n\n### Primary Actions (IMPORTANT!)\n1. **Neuen Abgleich starten** (Start new comparison) → Primary Action Button - users frequently need to initiate a comparison between an order and its confirmation\n2. View details of a specific discrepancy\n3. Mark comparison as reviewed/resolved\n\n---\n\n## 2. What Makes This Design Distinctive\n\n### Visual Identity\nA cool, precise aesthetic that reflects the analytical nature of procurement work. The design uses a slate-blue undertone throughout with a bold teal accent that signals \"comparison\" and \"verification\" - trust and accuracy without being cold. The typography is technical and precise (IBM Plex Sans) reflecting the data-driven nature of the work, while generous spacing keeps the dense information scannable.\n\n### Layout Strategy\nThe layout uses **asymmetric weighting** to create clear hierarchy:\n- **Hero section** dominates the top with a large status indicator showing the critical match rate\n- Two smaller supporting KPIs sit beside it (total comparisons, pending reviews)\n- Below, a full-width recent comparisons list shows the actual work items\n- The asymmetry comes from the hero being 2x the visual weight of supporting KPIs\n\nVisual interest is created through:\n- **Size variation**: Hero KPI is 48px vs 24px for secondary metrics\n- **Color coding**: Green/red/amber status indicators create immediate meaning\n- **Card depth variation**: Hero card has more elevation than list items\n- **Whitespace**: Hero section has extra breathing room below it\n\n### Unique Element\nA **circular progress ring** around the match rate percentage that fills based on the success ratio. When 100% of comparisons match, the ring is completely green. As discrepancies increase, the ring shows a red segment. This gamification-inspired element makes the abstract match rate visceral and immediately understandable - like a health meter in a game.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Theme & Colors\n\n### Font\n- **Family:** IBM Plex Sans\n- **URL:** `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=IBM+Plex+Sans:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap`\n- **Why this font:** IBM Plex Sans conveys technical precision and trustworthiness - perfect for a data verification system. Its slightly condensed characters allow more data to fit while remaining highly readable.\n\n### Color Palette\nAll colors as complete hsl() functions:\n\n| Purpose | Color | CSS Variable |\n|---------|-------|--------------|\n| Page background | `hsl(210 20% 98%)` | `--background` |\n| Main text | `hsl(215 25% 17%)` | `--foreground` |\n| Card background | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--card` |\n| Card text | `hsl(215 25% 17%)` | `--card-foreground` |\n| Borders | `hsl(214 20% 90%)` | `--border` |\n| Primary action | `hsl(173 58% 39%)` | `--primary` |\n| Text on primary | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--primary-foreground` |\n| Accent highlight | `hsl(173 40% 95%)` | `--accent` |\n| Muted background | `hsl(210 20% 96%)` | `--muted` |\n| Muted text | `hsl(215 16% 47%)` | `--muted-foreground` |\n| Success/positive | `hsl(158 64% 40%)` | (component use) |\n| Error/negative | `hsl(0 72% 51%)` | `--destructive` |\n\n### Why These Colors\nThe cool slate-blue base creates a calm, professional environment that doesn't fatigue eyes during long work sessions. The teal primary is distinctive without being loud - it suggests verification and checking (like a checkmark color). The subtle warm cream undertone in the background prevents it from feeling sterile. Red and green are used sparingly only for status indicators where color meaning is universal.\n\n### Background Treatment\nThe background is a subtle cool gray-blue (`hsl(210 20% 98%)`) - not pure white - creating depth when cards sit on top. No gradients or patterns; the simplicity keeps focus on the data.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\nDesign mobile as a COMPLETELY SEPARATE experience optimized for quick status checks on the go.\n\n### Layout Approach\nMobile uses a stacked vertical flow with the hero status ring taking prominent center position. The design assumes mobile users are checking \"is everything okay?\" rather than doing deep analysis. Size variation creates hierarchy: the hero ring is large and centered, while KPIs use a compact horizontal arrangement.\n\n### What Users See (Top to Bottom)\n\n**Header:**\n- App title \"Bestellabgleich\" left-aligned, 20px semibold\n- Primary action button \"Neuer Abgleich\" as icon button (+ icon) in top right, 44px touch target\n\n**Hero Section (The FIRST thing users see):**\n- Large circular progress ring, 180px diameter, centered\n- Inside the ring: Match rate percentage in 48px bold (e.g., \"87%\")\n- Below the number: \"Übereinstimmung\" label in 14px muted text\n- Ring stroke is 10px with rounded caps\n- Green fill for matched portion, red for mismatched\n- Takes approximately 45% of initial viewport height\n- **Why this is hero:** Users opening on mobile want instant status - \"are there problems?\" This ring gives that answer in under 1 second.\n\n**Section 2: Quick Stats Row**\n- Horizontal row of 3 compact stats, not cards - just inline numbers\n- \"23 Abgleiche\" | \"3 Abweichungen\" | \"5 Offen\"\n- Each stat: 24px number above 12px label, separated by thin vertical dividers\n- This row is dense and scannable, contrasting with the spacious hero above\n\n**Section 3: Aktuelle Abgleiche (Recent Comparisons)**\n- Section header \"Aktuelle Abgleiche\" 16px semibold\n- List of comparison cards, each card showing:\n  - Status indicator dot (green/red) on left edge, 12px\n  - Order number and confirmation number on two lines\n  - Supplier name in muted text\n  - Date on right side\n  - Chevron indicating tap-to-expand\n- Cards have minimal padding (12px) and 4px gap between them\n- Show last 5 comparisons, then \"Alle anzeigen\" link\n\n**Bottom Navigation / Action:**\n- Floating action button (FAB) in bottom-right corner\n- Teal primary color, 56px diameter\n- Plus icon inside\n- 16px margin from edges\n- This duplicates the header action for thumb-friendly access\n\n### Mobile-Specific Adaptations\n- Hero ring is centered and larger relative to screen than on desktop\n- Stats row is horizontal scroll if needed, but 3 stats should fit\n- Comparison cards are full-width with reduced padding\n- No hover states - tap feedback via subtle scale animation\n\n### Touch Targets\n- All tappable elements minimum 44px\n- FAB is 56px for easy thumb reach\n- Card rows have full-width tap area\n\n### Interactive Elements\n- Tapping a comparison card expands it inline to show discrepancy details (if any)\n- Collapsible accordion pattern - only one expanded at a time\n\n---\n\n## 5. Desktop Layout\n\n### Overall Structure\nTwo-column layout with 65/35 split:\n- **Left column (65%):** Hero metrics section + comparison list\n- **Right column (35%):** Quick filters and summary sidebar\n\nThe eye flows: Hero ring (top-left) → Supporting KPIs (below hero) → Comparison list (scrollable main content) → Filters (right sidebar for power users)\n\nVisual interest comes from the asymmetric column split and the hero ring's size dominance.\n\n### Section Layout\n\n**Top Area (Left Column):**\n- Hero card spans full left column width\n- Contains: Large progress ring (200px) on left, text stats on right\n- Ring shows match percentage with green/red segments\n- Right of ring:\n  - \"87%\" large number (56px)\n  - \"Übereinstimmung\" label\n  - \"23 von 26 Abgleichen erfolgreich\" subtext\n- Card has subtle shadow (0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06))\n\n**Below Hero (Left Column):**\n- Row of 3 metric cards, equal width\n- \"Gesamt-Abgleiche\" (total comparisons) - count + trend\n- \"Abweichungen\" (discrepancies) - count, red accent if > 0\n- \"Ausstehend\" (pending review) - count, amber if > 0\n- Each card: Number large (32px), label below (14px muted)\n\n**Main Content (Left Column):**\n- \"Aktuelle Abgleiche\" section header with sort dropdown\n- Table-style list showing:\n  - Status column (dot indicator)\n  - Bestellnummer (order number)\n  - AB-Nummer (confirmation number)\n  - Lieferant (supplier)\n  - Datum (date)\n  - Abweichungen (discrepancy count or \"Keine\")\n- Alternating row backgrounds for scanability\n- Pagination at bottom\n\n**Right Sidebar (35%):**\n- Sticky position, doesn't scroll with main content\n- \"Filter\" section:\n  - Status filter (Alle / Übereinstimmend / Abweichend)\n  - Date range picker\n  - Supplier dropdown\n- \"Neuer Abgleich\" primary button, full sidebar width\n- Below button: Quick stats summary\n  - Documents this week\n  - Avg. processing time\n\n### What Appears on Hover\n- Table rows highlight with subtle background tint\n- Comparison rows show \"Details anzeigen\" link on right\n- Metric cards show subtle elevation increase\n\n### Clickable/Interactive Areas\n- Clicking any comparison row opens a detail modal showing:\n  - Full comparison data\n  - Side-by-side order vs confirmation fields\n  - Highlighted discrepancies in red\n  - \"Als geprüft markieren\" action button\n\n---\n\n## 6. Components\n\n### Hero KPI\nThe MOST important metric that users see first.\n\n- **Title:** Übereinstimmungsrate (Match Rate)\n- **Data source:** Abgleichsergebnis app\n- **Calculation:** Count records where `abgleich_status === true` divided by total records, multiply by 100\n- **Display:** Large percentage number (56px desktop, 48px mobile) inside a circular progress ring\n- **Context shown:** Ring visualization shows proportion, subtext shows \"X von Y Abgleichen erfolgreich\"\n- **Why this is the hero:** The match rate is the single number that tells users if the system is healthy or needs attention. Everything else is supporting detail.\n\n### Secondary KPIs\n\n**Gesamt-Abgleiche (Total Comparisons)**\n- Source: Abgleichsergebnis (count all records)\n- Calculation: Simple count\n- Format: number\n- Display: Card with large number\n\n**Abweichungen (Discrepancies)**\n- Source: Abgleichsergebnis where `abgleich_status === false`\n- Calculation: Count of failed comparisons\n- Format: number with red accent if > 0\n- Display: Card with large number, destructive color when > 0\n\n**Ausstehende Prüfungen (Pending Reviews)**\n- Source: Abgleichsergebnis where `abgleich_weiter === false` or null\n- Calculation: Count of items not yet marked as reviewed\n- Format: number with amber accent if > 0\n- Display: Card with large number\n\n### Chart (if applicable)\n- **Type:** None for initial version - the circular progress ring serves as the primary visualization\n- The data is more suited to lists than time-series charts since comparisons are discrete events\n\n### Lists/Tables\n\n**Aktuelle Abgleiche (Recent Comparisons)**\n- Purpose: Show the actual work items users need to review\n- Source: Abgleichsergebnis joined with AbgleichStarten → Bestellung and Auftragsbestaetigung\n- Fields shown:\n  - Status indicator (from abgleich_status)\n  - Bestellnummer (from linked Bestellung)\n  - AB-Nummer (from linked Auftragsbestaetigung)\n  - Lieferant (from linked Bestellung)\n  - Datum (createdat from Abgleichsergebnis)\n  - Abweichungen count or \"Keine\"\n- Mobile style: Compact cards with status dot, stacked text\n- Desktop style: Table rows with columns\n- Sort: By date descending (newest first)\n- Limit: 10 items with pagination\n\n### Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n\n- **Label:** \"Neuer Abgleich\" (mobile: plus icon only in FAB)\n- **Action:** navigate to comparison selection\n- **Target app:** Opens a modal/dialog to select Bestellung and Auftragsbestaetigung to compare\n- **What data:** User selects from dropdown: 1) Bestellung, 2) Auftragsbestaetigung - then submits to create AbgleichStarten record\n- **Mobile position:** FAB (bottom-right floating action button) + small icon button in header\n- **Desktop position:** Sidebar, full-width button at top of right column\n- **Why this action:** Starting a new comparison is the most frequent action - users receive new confirmations constantly and need to verify them against orders\n\n---\n\n## 7. Visual Details\n\n### Border Radius\nRounded (8px) - professional but not sharp, not overly soft\n\n### Shadows\nSubtle - cards use `0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)`, hero card slightly more `0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`\n\n### Spacing\nSpacious - 24px gap between major sections, 16px within cards, 8px between list items\n\n### Animations\n- **Page load:** Subtle fade-in (200ms), progress ring animates from 0 to actual value (600ms ease-out)\n- **Hover effects:** Cards lift slightly with increased shadow\n- **Tap feedback:** Brief scale to 0.98 on mobile touch\n\n---\n\n## 8. CSS Variables (Copy Exactly!)\n\nThe implementer MUST copy these values exactly into `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --background: hsl(210 20% 98%);\n  --foreground: hsl(215 25% 17%);\n  --card: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(215 25% 17%);\n  --popover: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(215 25% 17%);\n  --primary: hsl(173 58% 39%);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --secondary: hsl(210 20% 96%);\n  --secondary-foreground: hsl(215 25% 17%);\n  --muted: hsl(210 20% 96%);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(215 16% 47%);\n  --accent: hsl(173 40% 95%);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(215 25% 17%);\n  --destructive: hsl(0 72% 51%);\n  --border: hsl(214 20% 90%);\n  --input: hsl(214 20% 90%);\n  --ring: hsl(173 58% 39%);\n  --chart-1: hsl(158 64% 40%);\n  --chart-2: hsl(0 72% 51%);\n  --chart-3: hsl(45 93% 47%);\n  --chart-4: hsl(173 58% 39%);\n  --chart-5: hsl(215 16% 47%);\n  --radius: 0.5rem;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9.

Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\nDesign mobile as a COMPLETELY SEPARATE experience optimized for quick status checks on the go.\n\n### Layout Approach\nMobile uses a stacked vertical flow with the hero status ring taking prominent center position. The design assumes mobile users are checking \"is everything okay?\" rather than doing deep analysis. Size variation creates hierarchy: the hero ring is large and centered, while KPIs use a compact horizontal arrangement.\n\n### What Users See (Top to Bottom)\n\n**Header:**\n- App title \"Bestellabgleich\" left-aligned, 20px semibold\n- Primary action button \"Neuer Abgleich\" as icon button (+ icon) in top right, 44px touch target\n\n**Hero Section (The FIRST thing users see):**\n- Large circular progress ring, 180px diameter, centered\n- Inside the ring: Match rate percentage in 48px bold (e.g., \"87%\")\n- Below the number: \"Übereinstimmung\" label in 14px muted text\n- Ring stroke is 10px with rounded caps\n- Green fill for matched portion, red for mismatched\n- Takes approximately 45% of initial viewport height\n- **Why this is hero:** Users opening on mobile want instant status - \"are there problems?\" This ring gives that answer in under 1 second.\n\n**Section 2: Quick Stats Row**\n- Horizontal row of 3 compact stats, not cards - just inline numbers\n- \"23 Abgleiche\" | \"3 Abweichungen\" | \"5 Offen\"\n- Each stat: 24px number above 12px label, separated by thin vertical dividers\n- This row is dense and scannable, contrasting with the spacious hero above\n\n**Section 3: Aktuelle Abgleiche (Recent Comparisons)**\n- Section header \"Aktuelle Abgleiche\" 16px semibold\n- List of comparison cards, each card showing:\n  - Status indicator dot (green/red) on left edge, 12px\n  - Order number and confirmation number on two lines\n  - Supplier name in muted text\n  - Date on right side\n  - Chevron indicating tap-to-expand\n- Cards have minimal padding (12px) and 4px gap between them\n- Show last 5 comparisons, then \"Alle anzeigen\" link\n\n**Bottom Navigation / Action:**\n- Floating action button (FAB) in bottom-right corner\n- Teal primary color, 56px diameter\n- Plus icon inside\n- 16px margin from edges\n- This duplicates the header action for thumb-friendly access\n\n### Mobile-Specific Adaptations\n- Hero ring is centered and larger relative to screen than on desktop\n- Stats row is horizontal scroll if needed, but 3 stats should fit\n- Comparison cards are full-width with reduced padding\n- No hover states - tap feedback via subtle scale animation\n\n### Touch Targets\n- All tappable elements minimum 44px\n- FAB is 56px for easy thumb reach\n- Card rows have full-width tap area\n\n### Interactive Elements\n- Tapping a comparison card expands it inline to show discrepancy details (if any)\n- Collapsible accordion pattern - only one expanded at a time\n\n---\n\n## 5. Desktop Layout\n\n### Overall Structure\nTwo-column layout with 65/35 split:\n- **Left column (65%):** Hero metrics section + comparison list\n- **Right column (35%):** Quick filters and summary sidebar\n\nThe eye flows: Hero ring (top-left) → Supporting KPIs (below hero) → Comparison list (scrollable main content) → Filters (right sidebar for power users)\n\nVisual interest comes from the asymmetric column split and the hero ring's size dominance.\n\n### Section Layout\n\n**Top Area (Left Column):**\n- Hero card spans full left column width\n- Contains: Large progress ring (200px) on left, text stats on right\n- Ring shows match percentage with green/red segments\n- Right of ring:\n  - \"87%\" large number (56px)\n  - \"Übereinstimmung\" label\n  - \"23 von 26 Abgleichen erfolgreich\" subtext\n- Card has subtle shadow (0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06))\n\n**Below Hero (Left Column):**\n- Row of 3 metric cards, equal width\n- \"Gesamt-Abgleiche\" (total comparisons) - count + trend\n- \"Abweichungen\" (discrepancies) - count, red accent if > 0\n- \"Ausstehend\" (pending review) - count, amber if > 0\n- Each card: Number large (32px), label below (14px muted)\n\n**Main Content (Left Column):**\n- \"Aktuelle Abgleiche\" section header with sort dropdown\n- Table-style list showing:\n  - Status column (dot indicator)\n  - Bestellnummer (order number)\n  - AB-Nummer (confirmation number)\n  - Lieferant (supplier)\n  - Datum (date)\n  - Abweichungen (discrepancy count or \"Keine\")\n- Alternating row backgrounds for scanability\n- Pagination at bottom\n\n**Right Sidebar (35%):**\n- Sticky position, doesn't scroll with main content\n- \"Filter\" section:\n  - Status filter (Alle / Übereinstimmend / Abweichend)\n  - Date range picker\n  - Supplier dropdown\n- \"Neuer Abgleich\" primary button, full sidebar width\n- Below button: Quick stats summary\n  - Documents this week\n  - Avg. processing time\n\n### What Appears on Hover\n- Table rows highlight with subtle background tint\n- Comparison rows show \"Details anzeigen\" link on right\n- Metric cards show subtle elevation increase\n\n### Clickable/Interactive Areas\n- Clicking any comparison row opens a detail modal showing:\n  - Full comparison data\n  - Side-by-side order vs confirmation fields\n  - Highlighted discrepancies in red\n  - \"Als geprüft markieren\" action button\n\n---\n\n## 6. Components\n\n### Hero KPI\nThe MOST important metric that users see first.\n\n- **Title:** Übereinstimmungsrate (Match Rate)\n- **Data source:** Abgleichsergebnis app\n- **Calculation:** Count records where `abgleich_status === true` divided by total records, multiply by 100\n- **Display:** Large percentage number (56px desktop, 48px mobile) inside a circular progress ring\n- **Context shown:** Ring visualization shows proportion, subtext shows \"X von Y Abgleichen erfolgreich\"\n- **Why this is the hero:** The match rate is the single number that tells users if the system is healthy or needs attention. Everything else is supporting detail.\n\n### Secondary KPIs\n\n**Gesamt-Abgleiche (Total Comparisons)**\n- Source: Abgleichsergebnis (count all records)\n- Calculation: Simple count\n- Format: number\n- Display: Card with large number\n\n**Abweichungen (Discrepancies)**\n- Source: Abgleichsergebnis where `abgleich_status === false`\n- Calculation: Count of failed comparisons\n- Format: number with red accent if > 0\n- Display: Card with large number, destructive color when > 0\n\n**Ausstehende Prüfungen (Pending Reviews)**\n- Source: Abgleichsergebnis where `abgleich_weiter === false` or null\n- Calculation: Count of items not yet marked as reviewed\n- Format: number with amber accent if > 0\n- Display: Card with large number\n\n### Chart (if applicable)\n- **Type:** None for initial version - the circular progress ring serves as the primary visualization\n- The data is more suited to lists than time-series charts since comparisons are discrete events\n\n### Lists/Tables\n\n**Aktuelle Abgleiche (Recent Comparisons)**\n- Purpose: Show the actual work items users need to review\n- Source: Abgleichsergebnis joined with AbgleichStarten → Bestellung and Auftragsbestaetigung\n- Fields shown:\n  - Status indicator (from abgleich_status)\n  - Bestellnummer (from linked Bestellung)\n  - AB-Nummer (from linked Auftragsbestaetigung)\n  - Lieferant (from linked Bestellung)\n  - Datum (createdat from Abgleichsergebnis)\n  - Abweichungen count or \"Keine\"\n- Mobile style: Compact cards with status dot, stacked text\n- Desktop style: Table rows with columns\n- Sort: By date descending (newest first)\n- Limit: 10 items with pagination\n\n### Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n\n- **Label:** \"Neuer Abgleich\" (mobile: plus icon only in FAB)\n- **Action:** navigate to comparison selection\n- **Target app:** Opens a modal/dialog to select Bestellung and Auftragsbestaetigung to compare\n- **What data:** User selects from dropdown: 1) Bestellung, 2) Auftragsbestaetigung - then submits to create AbgleichStarten record\n- **Mobile position:** FAB (bottom-right floating action button) + small icon button in header\n- **Desktop position:** Sidebar, full-width button at top of right column\n- **Why this action:** Starting a new comparison is the most frequent action - users receive new confirmations constantly and need to verify them against orders\n\n---\n\n## 7. Visual Details\n\n### Border Radius\nRounded (8px) - professional but not sharp, not overly soft\n\n### Shadows\nSubtle - cards use `0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)`, hero card slightly more `0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`\n\n### Spacing\nSpacious - 24px gap between major sections, 16px within cards, 8px between list items\n\n### Animations\n- **Page load:** Subtle fade-in (200ms), progress ring animates from 0 to actual value (600ms ease-out)\n- **Hover effects:** Cards lift slightly with increased shadow\n- **Tap feedback:** Brief scale to 0.98 on mobile touch\n\n---\n\n## 8. CSS Variables (Copy Exactly!)\n\nThe implementer MUST copy these values exactly into `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --background: hsl(210 20% 98%);\n  --foreground: hsl(215 25% 17%);\n  --card: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(215 25% 17%);\n  --popover: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(215 25% 17%);\n  --primary: hsl(173 58% 39%);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --secondary: hsl(210 20% 96%);\n  --secondary-foreground: hsl(215 25% 17%);\n  --muted: hsl(210 20% 96%);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(215 16% 47%);\n  --accent: hsl(173 40% 95%);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(215 25% 17%);\n  --destructive: hsl(0 72% 51%);\n  --border: hsl(214 20% 90%);\n  --input: hsl(214 20% 90%);\n  --ring: hsl(173 58% 39%);\n  --chart-1: hsl(158 64% 40%);\n  --chart-2: hsl(0 72% 51%);\n  --chart-3: hsl(45 93% 47%);\n  --chart-4: hsl(173 58% 39%);\n  --chart-5: hsl(215 16% 47%);\n  --radius: 0.5rem;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9.

Pay attention to:\n\n- **Section 3: Theme & Colors** → Font name, URL, and all color values\n- **Section 4: Mobile Layout** → Exact structure for phone screens\n- **Section 5: Desktop Layout** → Exact structure for computer screens\n- **Section 6: Components** → Hero KPI, secondary KPIs, charts, lists\n- **Section 7: Visual Details** → Border radius, shadows, animations\n- **Section 8: CSS Variables** → Copy these EXACTLY into src/index.css\n\nThe brief explains WHY decisions were made. This helps you understand intent, but your job is to implement what is written, not to interpret.\n\n### Step 2: Read Existing Code\n\n```bash\ncat src/types/*.ts\ncat src/services/livingAppsService.ts\n```\n\n### Step 3: Apply CSS Variables FIRST (CRITICAL!)\n\nBefore writing any React code, update the theme. Copy the CSS from **Section 8** of design_brief.md into `src/index.css`.\n\nshadcn/ui components use Tailwind CSS variables. If you don't update them, `<Card>`, `<Button>`, etc. will use **default colors** that don't match the design!\n\n```\ndesign_brief.md → src/index.css → Tailwind classes → shadcn components\n   (Section 8)      (CSS variables)   (bg-card, etc.)   (Card, Button)\n```\n\n#### Step 3a: Copy CSS Variables\n\nThe design_brief.md Section 8 contains ready-to-copy CSS. Copy it EXACTLY:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Copy ALL values from design_brief.md Section 8 */\n  --background: hsl(...);\n  --foreground: hsl(...);\n  /* etc. */\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 3b: Light Mode (Always)\n\nThe design brief uses light mode. Make sure `index.html` does NOT have `class=\"dark\"`:\n\n```html\n<html lang=\"de\">  <!-- No \"dark\" class for light theme -->\n```\n\n### Step 4: Add Font\n\nCopy the font URL from **Section 3** of design_brief.md into `index.html`:\n\n```html\n<link href=\"[URL from Section 3]\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\n### Step 5: Implement Dashboard.tsx\n\nNow implement the React component following the brief:\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Imports (always use 'import type' for types!)\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport type { AppType1, AppType2 } from '@/types/app';\nimport { LivingAppsService } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\n// 2. Follow Section 4 (Mobile) and Section 5 (Desktop) for layout\n// 3. Follow Section 6 for components (Hero, KPIs, Charts, Lists)\n// 4. Follow Section 7 for visual details (radius, shadows, animations)\n```\n\n### Step 6: Build and Deploy\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThen call `mcp__deploy_tools__deploy_to_github`\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Light mode defaults - used when NO .dark class */\n}\n\n.dark {\n  /* Dark mode - used when <html class=\"dark\"> */\n}\n```\n\n**Color Mapping Table:**\n\n| design_brief.md section | CSS Variable | Used by |\n|----------------------|--------------|---------|\n| `theme.colors.background` | `--background` | `bg-background`, body |\n| `theme.colors.foreground` | `--foreground` | `text-foreground`, body text |\n| `theme.colors.card` | `--card` | `<Card>` background |\n| `theme.colors.foreground` | `--card-foreground` | Text inside cards |\n| `theme.colors.primary` | `--primary` | `<Button>` default |\n| `theme.colors.accent` | `--accent` | Accent elements |\n| `theme.colors.muted` | `--muted` | Muted backgrounds |\n| `theme.colors.border` | `--border` | All borders |\n| `theme.colors.positive` | `--chart-2` | Success/positive in charts |\n| `theme.colors.negative` | `--destructive` | Error/negative |\n\n#### Step 4c: Example - Applying a Dark Theme\n\nIf design_brief.md says:\n```json\n{\n  \"theme\": {\n    \"mode\": \"dark\",\n    \"colors\": {\n      \"background\": \"hsl(215 28% 7%)\",\n      \"foreground\": \"hsl(215 10% 92%)\",\n      \"card\": \"hsl(215 25% 12%)\",\n      \"primary\": \"hsl(25 95% 53%)\",\n      \"accent\": \"hsl(173 80% 45%)\",\n      \"muted\": \"hsl(215 15% 20%)\",\n      \"border\": \"hsl(215 20% 18%)\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen update `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  --foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --card: hsl(215 25% 12%);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --popover: hsl(215 25% 12%);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --primary: hsl(25 95% 53%);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  \n  --accent: hsl(173 80% 45%);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  \n  --muted: hsl(215 15% 20%);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(215 10% 70%);\n  \n  --border: hsl(215 20% 18%);\n  --input: hsl(215 20% 18%);\n  --ring: hsl(173 80% 45%);\n}\n```\n\nAnd update `index.html`:\n```html\n<html lang=\"de\" class=\"dark\">\n```\n\n#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: CSS Color Format\n\nThe CSS variables **MUST use complete color functions**, not raw values!\n\n**❌ WRONG - Raw values break Tailwind:**\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: 220 25% 6%;        /* ❌ Just numbers - NOT a valid CSS color! */\n  --card: 220 20% 10%;             /* ❌ Browser ignores this, uses fallback! */\n}\n```\n\n**✅ CORRECT - Complete color functions:**\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: hsl(220 25% 6%);   /* ✓ Complete hsl() function */\n  --card: hsl(220 20% 10%);        /* ✓ Tailwind can use this */\n}\n```\n\n**Why raw values fail:**\n- Tailwind reads `var(--background)` directly for `bg-background`\n- If `--background` is `220 25% 6%` (just numbers), it's NOT a valid CSS color\n- Browser ignores invalid colors → falls back to white/transparent\n- Result: Light backgrounds with dark text = invisible!\n\n**Always copy the FULL hsl() function from design_brief.md Section 8, including the function name!**\n\n#### Why This Matters\n\nWithout this step:\n- `<Card>` uses default background (light/white)\n- Text colors (from design_brief) are for dark backgrounds\n- Result: **Light text on light cards = invisible!**\n\nWith this step:\n- All shadcn components automatically use your theme colors\n- Consistent look across all UI elements\n- No need to add inline styles everywhere\n\n### Step 5: Add Font from Spec\n\nIn `index.html`, add the font URL from design_brief.md Section 3:\n```html\n<link href=\"{font_url from spec}\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\n### Step 6: Build and Test\n\n```bash\nnpm run build  # Must compile without errors\n```\n\n### Step 7: Deploy\n\n```\nCall mcp__deploy_tools__deploy_to_github\n```\n\n---\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### 1. Type Imports\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG\nimport { Workout } from '@/types/app';\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nimport type { Workout } from '@/types/app';\n```\n\n### 2. extractRecordId Always Has Null Check\n```typescript\nconst id = extractRecordId(record.fields.relation);\nif (!id) return;  // ✅ Always check!\n```\n\n### 3. Dates Without Seconds\n```typescript\n// For API: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM (no seconds!)\nconst dateForAPI = formData.date + 'T12:00';\n```\n\n### 4. Select Never Has Empty Value\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG\n<SelectItem value=\"\">None</SelectItem>\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\n<SelectItem value=\"none\">None</SelectItem>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\nBefore completing, verify EACH item against design_brief.md:\n\n### Theme Verification (CRITICAL!)\n- [ ] Font in `index.html` is EXACTLY from design_brief.md Section 3 (NOT Inter or Roboto!)\n- [ ] Font-family in CSS matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 3\n- [ ] `index.html` has NO \"dark\" class (light theme)\n- [ ] ALL CSS variables in `src/index.css` copied EXACTLY from design_brief.md Section 8\n- [ ] Colors are complete hsl() functions (not raw values)\n\n### Layout Verification\n- [ ] Mobile layout matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 4\n- [ ] Desktop layout matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 5\n- [ ] Hero element stands out as described\n- [ ] Section order matches the brief\n\n### Components Verification\n- [ ] Hero KPI matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6 \"Hero KPI\"\n- [ ] Secondary KPIs match EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6\n- [ ] Chart matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6 \"Chart\"\n- [ ] Primary action matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6\n\n### Visual Details Verification\n- [ ] Border radius matches design_brief.md Section 7\n- [ ] Shadow style matches design_brief.md Section 7\n- [ ] Animations match design_brief.md Section 7\n\n### Technical\n- [ ] `npm run build` passes\n- [ ] No console errors\n\n### ⚠️ COMPLETENESS VERIFICATION (CRITICAL!)\n\n**You MUST verify the dashboard is 100% complete before finishing:**\n\n- [ ] **Every app in app_metadata.json is used** - no data sources ignored\n- [ ] **Primary action works** (create new record via dialog/form)\n- [ ] **Data displays correctly** (all KPIs calculated, lists populated)\n- [ ] **All states handled:**\n  - [ ] Loading states for every data fetch\n  - [ ] Empty states with helpful guidance\n  - [ ] Error states with retry options\n- [ ] **Nothing is placeholder:**\n  - [ ] No \"TODO\" comments in code\n  - [ ] No \"Coming soon\" messages\n  - [ ] No hardcoded demo data\n\n**If ANY item above is unchecked, the dashboard is NOT complete. Fix it before deploying.**\n\n---\n\n## Definition of Done\n\nThe dashboard is complete when:\n\n1. ✅ **User experience excellent**: Intuitive, clear, professional\n2. ✅ **Primary action button works** (with Dialog/Modal)\n3. ✅ All KPIs/Stats calculated correctly\n4. ✅ Loading state works (Skeleton, not empty page)\n5. ✅ Error handling implemented (friendly messages)\n6. ✅ Empty state implemented (helpful placeholders)\n7. ✅ Responsive design (Mobile + Desktop)\n8. ✅ No TypeScript errors (`npm run build`)\n9. ✅ No console errors in browser\n10. ✅ Business logic correct\n11. ✅ Living Apps API rules followed (dates, applookup, response)\n12. ✅ **All features complete** - nothing skipped or left as TODO\n\n---\n\n## Drill-Down: When and How to Use It\n\nDrill-down is useful when there's **more information to show** than fits in the summary view. Don't add it everywhere - only where it adds value.\n\n### When to Use Drill-Down\n\n| Good Use Cases | Skip Drill-Down When... |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| List item → show full record details | The summary already shows everything |\n| Summary count → show the items being counted | It's a simple, self-explanatory number |\n| Record reference → view the related record | There's no additional detail to show |\n\n### Make It Obvious\n\nIf something is clickable, make it visually clear:\n- Hover effect (shadow, background change)\n- Cursor pointer\n- Underline or chevron icon for \"see more\"\n\n### Implementation Pattern: Clickable List Item\n\n```typescript\n// Use when list items have more details to show\n<div\n  className=\"p-3 rounded-lg hover:bg-muted cursor-pointer transition-colors\"\n  onClick={() => setSelectedRecord(record)}\n>\n  <div className=\"font-medium\">{record.name}</div>\n  <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">{record.summary}</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Don't force drill-down everywhere.** A simple KPI that shows \"5 workouts this week\" doesn't need a click handler if there's nothing more to show.\n\n---\n\n## UX Details - Don't Forget!\n\n### Loading States\n```typescript\nif (loading) {\n  return <LoadingState />;  // Use Skeleton, not spinner\n}\n```\n\n### Empty States\n```typescript\nif (data.length === 0) {\n  return (\n    <EmptyState \n      title=\"No data yet\"\n      description=\"Get started by adding your first item\"\n      action={<Button>Add First Item</Button>}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Error States\n```typescript\nif (error) {\n  return (\n    <Alert variant=\"destructive\">\n      <AlertCircle className=\"h-4 w-4\" />\n      <AlertTitle>Error</AlertTitle>\n      <AlertDescription>\n        {error.message}\n        <Button variant=\"outline\" onClick={retry}>Try Again</Button>\n      </AlertDescription>\n    </Alert>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Success Feedback\n```typescript\n// Use toast for success messages\nimport { toast } from '@/components/ui/use-toast';\n\ntoast({\n  title: \"Success!\",\n  description: \"Item saved successfully.\",\n});\n```\n\n### Hover States\n```typescript\n// Cards should have hover feedback\n<Card className=\"hover:shadow-md transition-shadow cursor-pointer\">\n```\n\n---\n\n# Living Apps API Reference\n\n## ⚠️ Critical API Rules\n\nThese rules are **non-negotiable**. Breaking them causes runtime errors.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Date Formats\n\nLiving Apps has strict date format requirements:\n\n| Field Type | Format | Example |\n|------------|--------|---------|\n| `date/datetimeminute` | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` | `2025-11-06T12:00` |\n| `date/date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | `2025-11-06` |\n\n### ❌ WRONG\n```typescript\n// Seconds are NOT allowed for datetimeminute!\nconst date = '2025-11-06T12:00:00';  // ❌ Will fail\n```\n\n### ✅ CORRECT\n```typescript\n// For date/datetimeminute fields\nconst dateForAPI = formData.datum + 'T12:00';  // ✅ YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM\n\n// For date/date fields\nconst dateForAPI = formData.datum;  // ✅ YYYY-MM-DD\n\n// Display in <input type=\"date\">\nconst dateForInput = apiData.datum?.split('T')[0];  // Extract YYYY-MM-DD\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. applookup Fields\n\n`applookup/select` fields store **full URLs** to related records.\n\n### URL Format\n```\nhttps://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n```\n\n### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Always use extractRecordId()\n\n```typescript\n// ❌ NEVER do this manually\nconst parts = url.split('/');\nconst id = parts[parts.length - 1];  // ❌ Fragile!\n\n// ✅ ALWAYS use the helper function\nimport { extractRecordId } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\nconst recordId = extractRecordId(url);\nif (!recordId) return;  // ✅ Always null-check!\n```\n\n### extractRecordId() Implementation\n```typescript\nexport function extractRecordId(url: string | null | undefined): string | null {\n  if (!url) return null;\n  // Extracts last 24 hex characters (Living Apps Record IDs)\n  const match = url.match(/([a-f0-9]{24})$/i);\n  return match ? match[1] : null;\n}\n```\n\n### Creating applookup Values\n```typescript\nimport { createRecordUrl, APP_IDS } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\n// When creating/updating records with applookup fields\nconst data = {\n  kategorie: createRecordUrl(APP_IDS.KATEGORIEN, selectedKategorieId),\n};\n\n// createRecordUrl returns:\n// 'https://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}'\n```\n\n### applookup Can Be Null!\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG - Will crash if field is null\nworkoutLogs.forEach((log) => {\n  const id = extractRecordId(log.fields.uebung);\n  data[id] = log;  // ❌ Crashes if id is null\n});\n\n// ✅ CORRECT - Defensive programming\nworkoutLogs.forEach((log) => {\n  const id = extractRecordId(log.fields.uebung);\n  if (!id) return;  // ✅ Skip if null\n  if (!data[id]) data[id] = [];\n  data[id].push(log);\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. API Response Format\n\nLiving Apps returns **objects**, not arrays!\n\n### Response Structure\n```typescript\n// API returns:\n{\n  \"690abc123...\": {\n    \"createdat\": \"2025-11-06T10:00:00\",\n    \"updatedat\": null,\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"name\": \"Item 1\",\n      \"value\": 100\n    }\n  },\n  \"690def456...\": {\n    \"createdat\": \"2025-11-06T11:00:00\",\n    \"updatedat\": null,\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"name\": \"Item 2\",\n      \"value\": 200\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### ❌ WRONG Transformation\n```typescript\n// Loses record_id!\nconst items = Object.values(response);  // ❌ No record_id!\n```\n\n### ✅ CORRECT Transformation\n```typescript\n// Use Object.entries() to preserve record_id\nconst items = Object.entries(response).map(([record_id, record]) => ({\n  record_id,  // ← From the key\n  createdat: record.createdat,\n  updatedat: record.updatedat,\n  ...record.fields,\n}));\n```\n\n### Why record_id Matters\n- Required for React `key` prop\n- Required for update/delete operations\n- Required for applookup references\n\n---\n\n## 4. API Authentication\n\n```typescript\nconst headers = {\n  'X-API-Key': API_KEY,  // From environment\n  'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  'Accept': 'application/json',\n};\n```\n\n### Proxy vs Direct URL\n```typescript\n// For API calls (via proxy)\nconst API_BASE = '/api/rest';\n\n// For applookup values (direct)\nconst APPLOOKUP_BASE = 'https://my.living-apps.de/rest';\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. CRUD Operations\n\n### GET All Records\n```typescript\nGET /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records\n```\n\n### GET Single Record\n```typescript\nGET /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n```\n\n### CREATE Record\n```typescript\nPOST /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"New Item\",\n  \"value\": 100\n}\n```\n\n### UPDATE Record\n```typescript\nPATCH /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"value\": 150  // Only changed fields\n}\n```\n\n### DELETE Record\n```typescript\nDELETE /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n\n// Note: DELETE also returns JSON, always call response.json()\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Error Handling\n\n```typescript\nasync function callAPI(method: string, endpoint: string, data?: any) {\n  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}${endpoint}`, {\n    method,\n    headers: {\n      'X-API-Key': API_KEY,\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n    },\n    body: data ? JSON.stringify(data) : undefined,\n  });\n\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    const errorText = await response.text();\n    throw new Error(`API Error (${response.status}): ${errorText}`);\n  }\n\n  return response.json();  // Always parse JSON, even for DELETE\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. Metadata Structure\n\n`app_metadata.json` contains the **complete, real metadata from Living Apps REST API**.\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n- `controls` is an **OBJECT** (not array!)\n- Each control has `identifier`, `label`, `type`, `subtype`, `fulltype`\n- `lookup/select` has `lookup_data` with all options\n- `applookup/select` has `lookup_app` URL to the linked app\n\n```typescript\n{\n  \"appgroup_id\": \"...\",\n  \"appgroup_name\": \"My App Group\",\n  \"apps\": {\n    \"app_identifier\": {\n      \"app_id\": \"...\",\n      \"name\": \"App Display Name\",\n      \"controls\": {\n        \"control_identifier\": {\n          \"identifier\": \"field_name\",      // Use this as field key\n          \"label\": \"Field Label\",          // Use this for UI display\n          \"type\": \"string\",                // Base type\n          \"subtype\": null,                 // or \"select\", \"textarea\", etc.\n          \"fulltype\": \"string/text\",       // Combined: type/subtype\n          \"lookup_data\": [                 // For lookup/select fields\n            { \"key\": \"option1\", \"value\": \"Option 1\" },\n            { \"key\": \"option2\", \"value\": \"Option 2\" }\n          ],\n          \"lookup_app\": \"https://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}\"  // For applookup\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Common Field Types\n| fulltype | TypeScript | Notes |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| `string/text` | `string` | Plain text |\n| `string/textarea` | `string` | Multiline text |\n| `number/number` | `number` | Numeric |\n| `bool/bool` | `boolean` | True/false |\n| `date/date` | `string` | YYYY-MM-DD |\n| `date/datetimeminute` | `string` | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM (NO seconds!) |\n| `lookup/select` | `string` | From predefined list (lookup_data) |\n| `applookup/select` | `string \\| null` | URL to another app's record |\n\n### Using Metadata for UI\n```typescript\n// Use field labels for UI\nconst fieldLabel = metadata.apps.myapp.controls.myfield.label;\n\n// Use lookup_data for Select options\nconst options = metadata.apps.myapp.controls.status.lookup_data;\n// → [{ key: \"active\", value: \"Active\" }, { key: \"done\", value: \"Done\" }]\n```\n\n---\n\n# Code Patterns Reference\n\n## Available Libraries\n\n### shadcn/ui Components\n\nAll shadcn components are pre-installed in `/src/components/ui/`\n\n```typescript\nimport { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from '@/components/ui/card';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport { Badge } from '@/components/ui/badge';\nimport { Input } from '@/components/ui/input';\nimport { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';\nimport { Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogTrigger } from '@/components/ui/dialog';\nimport { Table, TableBody, TableCell, TableHead, TableHeader, TableRow } from '@/components/ui/table';\nimport { Skeleton } from '@/components/ui/skeleton';\nimport { Alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle } from '@/components/ui/alert';\n// etc.\n```\n\n**To find specific components or examples, use shadcn MCP Tools:**\n```\nmcp_shadcn_search_items_in_registries(registries: ['@shadcn'], query: 'chart')\nmcp_shadcn_view_items_in_registries(items: ['@shadcn/card'])\nmcp_shadcn_get_item_examples_from_registries(registries: ['@shadcn'], query: 'card-demo')\n```\n\n### recharts (Charts)\n\nPre-installed!
